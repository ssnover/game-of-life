# game-of-life
An implementation of a Conway's Game of Life environment on GBA. The ultimate game should have two modes: Edit and Run mode which can be switched between with the Start button (Enter in mGBA). In Edit mode the player can change cells between Alive and Dead. Then in Run mode the player can observe the automata advance according to the rules of Conway's Game of Life.
